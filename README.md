## changelog
* 2023-01-26 initialized with ip\_is\_public.py, a really stupid way to determine if an IPv4 address is public. Don't use this unless you can't use Python's built ins or PCRE regular expressions.
* 2023-01-27 added a half-finished ip\_is\_iaas.py, which checks if an IPv4 address is in AWS, GCP, or OCI. I would like to make it do that for Azure too.
2023-02-17 mostly finished Azure support for ip\_is\_iaas.py.
